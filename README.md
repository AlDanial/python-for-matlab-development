## ``py2mat.m`` and ``mat2py.m``

MATLAB functions to convert arbitrary Python variables to
native MATLAB variables and vice versa can be found in the ``code`` directory:

* https://github.com/Apress/python-for-matlab-development/blob/main/code/matlab_py/py2mat.m
* https://github.com/Apress/python-for-matlab-development/blob/main/code/matlab_py/mat2py.m

## ``df2t.m`` and ``t2df.m``

Pandas dataframe to and from MATLAB table converters, conceptually
similar to ``py2mat.m`` and ``mat2py.m``, can be found at
Artem Lenskiy's [PandasToMatlab](https://github.com/Lenskiy/PandasToMatlab)
project.

## MATLAB Expo 2022

I gave a presentation, [Python for MATLAB Development](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/python-for-matlab-development-1653572942248.html),
(video, 24 minutes) on May 17 at the
[MATLAB Expo 2022](https://www.matlabexpo.com/online/2022/proceedings.html).

Slides and other files cited in the presentation can be found in
